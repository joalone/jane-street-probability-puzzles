# Jane Street — Probability Puzzle Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to selected **Jane Street puzzles** related to probability, implemented in Python.

My aim is to use computation to provide insight into each problem and to make the underlying probabilistic structure explicit. Each puzzle includes code and notes that document the reasoning and experiments used to reach the solution.
